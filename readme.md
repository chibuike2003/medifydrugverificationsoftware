      * `WTForms`
      * `requests` (if used for external API calls, though not explicitly shown in the provided snippets for calls)

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory or set environment variables directly:

```
SECRET_KEY='your_very_secret_key_here'
UPLOAD_FOLDER='static/uploads' # Or your preferred upload path
MAIL_USERNAME='your_gmail_username@gmail.com'
MAIL_PASSWORD='your_gmail_app_password' # Use an App Password if 2FA is enabled for Gmail
```

### 5\. Initialize the Database

```python
# From your Python interpreter or a separate script
from app import db, app

with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
    print("Database tables created.")
```

-----

## Usage

### 1\. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py # Assuming your main application file is named app.py
```

### 2\. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## Database Schema

MedifyApp utilizes SQLAlchemy to define its database models. Here's a brief overview of the key models:

  * **User:** Stores information for general users (fullname, email, regno, phone, password, points).
  * **Admin:** Manages administrative users (fullname, email, username, password\_hash).
  * **Drug:** Represents drug products (name, description, price, quantity, expiry\_date, image, distributor\_id).
  * **Distributor:** Stores information for drug distributors (fullname, company, email, phone, location, license, password\_hash, profile\_pic).
  * **AdminAddDues:** Records administrative dues (fullname, regno, admin\_id, sessions\_paid, date\_filled).
  * **Manufacturer:** Stores information for drug manufacturers (company\_name, contact\_person, email, phone, factory\_address, registration\_number, password\_hash, logo).
  * **ElectoralCandidate:** (Seems unrelated to MedifyApp, might be a leftover from another project) Stores electoral candidate details.
  * **UserLocation:** Stores user IP address and estimated location (ip\_address, city, region, country).
  * **FriendRequest:** Manages friend requests between users (sender\_id, receiver\_id, status, created\_at).
  * **Friendship:** Stores established friendships between users (user1\_id, user2\_id, created\_at).
  * **Community:** Represents user-created communities (name, description, profile\_picture, admin\_id, created\_at).
  * **Contact:** Stores messages submitted via the contact form (name, email, phone, subject, message).
